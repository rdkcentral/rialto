 * Component Test: Flush success
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that flush is successfully handled.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Flush - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Flush+and+Seek+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Create memory region for the shared buffer.
 *  Create a server that handles Control IPC requests.
 *  Initalise the control state to running for this test application.
 *  Initalise a audio video media session paused and prerolled.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Flush
 *   Server notifies the client that flush procedure has been queued in server
 *   Expect that the procedure status is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 2: Flush complete
 *   Server notifies the client that the Flush procedure has been completed.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Terminate the media session.
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is closed.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Flush is handled and forwarded to the server for PLAYING, PAUSED and END_OF_STREAM state.

/*
 * Component Test: Discard Data When Flushing
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that when flush is in progress data requests are discarded.

 *  Initalise a audio video media session paused and prerolled.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Need data
 *   Server notifies the client that it needs 20 frames of audio data.
 *
 *  Step 2: Flush in paused state
 *   Server notifies the client that flush procedure has been queued in server
 *   Expect that the procedure status is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 3: Add segment failure
 *   Add a segment.
 *   Expect that addSegment return failure.
 *
 *  Step 4: Have data ignored
 *   Notify the server of have data.
 *   Expect that have data is not propagted to the server while flushing.
 *
 *  Step 5: Flush complete
 *   Server notifies the client that the Flush procedure has been completed.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Terminate the media session.
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is closed.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Segments cannot be added and have data requests are silently ignored when a flush is in progress.
