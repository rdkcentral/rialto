/*
 * Component Test: Dual Video Playback
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test the playback of dual video content. Check that all states are transitioned successfully
 *  and data is written to the buffer.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Create, Destroy - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=226375556
 *  Start/Resume Playback, Pause Playback, Stop
 *   - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Create memory region for the shared buffer.
 *  Create a server that handles Control IPC requests.
 *  Initalise the control state to running for this test application.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session for primary video
 *   Create an instance of MediaPipeline.
 *   Expect that a session is created on the server.
 *   Check that the object returned is valid.
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content on primary
 *   Load MSE.
 *   Expect that load is propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach all sources to primary
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that attach source for video propagated to the server.
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that attach source for audio propagated to the server.
 *   Set all sources attached.
 *   Expect that all source attached is propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 4: Create a new media session for secondary video
 *   Create an instance of MediaPipeline with < max video capabilities.
 *   Expect that a session is created on the server.
 *   Check that the object returned is valid.
 *
 *  Step 5: Load content on secondary
 *   Load MSE.
 *   Expect that load is propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 6: Attach video only source to secondary
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that attach source for video propagated to the server.
 *   Set all sources attached.
 *   Expect that all source attached is propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 7: Buffer to paused state on primary
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Write audio frames.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PAUSED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 8: Buffer to paused state on secondary
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PAUSED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 9: Play primary
 *   Play the primary AV content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 9: Play secondary
 *   Play the secondary video only content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 10: Buffer more primary content
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Write audio frames.
 *   x3
 *
 *  Step 11: Buffer more secondary content
 *   Write video frames.
 *   x3
 *
 *  Step 12: Terminate the secondary media session
 *   Stop the playback on secondary session.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Destroy instance of MediaPipeline.
 *   Expect that the secondary session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 *  Step 13: Terminate the primary media session
 *   Stop the playback on primary session.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Destroy instance of MediaPipeline.
 *   Expect that the primary session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is closed.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  All API calls are propagated to the server.
 *  Both sessions are handled and played successfully in parallel without conflict.
 *  Data is successfully written to the shared memory.
 *
 * Code:
