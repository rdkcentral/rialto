/*
 * Component Test: Play Pause and Stop Api Failures
 * Test Objective:
 *  Check that failures returned directly from the Play, Pause and Stop apis and failures returned asyncronously
 *  during server state changes are handled correctly. Subsequent Api requests after failures are successful.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Start/Resume Playback, Pause Playback, Stop - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Create memory region for the shared buffer.
 *  Create a server that handles Control IPC requests.
 *  Initalise the control state to running for this test application.
 *  Initalise a audio video media session paused and prerolled.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Play api failure
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server and return failure.
 *
 *  Step 2: Playing state failure
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to FAILURE.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 3: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause api failure
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that pause propagated to the server and return failure.
 *
 *  Step 5: Paused state failure
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that pause propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to FAILURE.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 6: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that pause propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to PAUSED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 7: Stop api failure
 *   Stop the content.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the server and return failure.
 *
 *  Step 8: Stopped state failure
 *   Stop the content.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to FAILURE.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 9: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifys the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Terminate the media session.
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is closed.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  All failures are notified to the calling application.
 *  Failures are recoverable.
 *
 * Code:
