/*
 * Component Test: Render Frame
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test the render frame API.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Render Frame
 *   - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Create memory region for the shared buffer.
 *  Create a server that handles Control IPC requests.
 *  Initalise the control state to running for this test application.
 *  Initalise a audio video media session paused and prerolled.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Render frame start of playback
 *   RenderFrame.
 *   Expect that RenderFrame propagated to the server.
 *
 *  Step 2: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that play propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 3: Render frame failure
 *   RenderFrame.
 *   Expect that RenderFrame propagated to the server and return failure.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that pause propagated to the server.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to PAUSED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 5: Seek
 *   SetPosition to position 0s.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to SEEKING.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to FLUSHED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Write audio frames.
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *   Server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to PAUSED.
 *   Expect that the state change notification is propagated to the client.
 *
 *  Step 6: Render frame after seek
 *   RenderFrame.
 *   Expect that RenderFrame propagated to the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Terminate the media session.
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is closed.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Render frame is successful if playback is paused either at the start of playback or
 *  immediately after a seek operation, failure otherwise.
 *
 * Code:
