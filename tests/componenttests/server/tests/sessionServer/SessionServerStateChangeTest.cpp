 * Component Test: RialtoApplicationSessionServer goes from Not Running -> Unitialized (server preloading) -> active sequence
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that the server can be successfully started in an uninitialised state and then activated
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ASP&title=Rialto+Application+Session+Management
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: RialtoApplicationSessionServer with stubs for RialtoClient and RialtoServerManager
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *   RialtoServerComponentTest::RialtoServerComponentTest() will set up wrappers and
 *      starts the application server running in its own thread
 *
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step A1: monitor socket creation
 *      sets up the Linux Wrapper so that socket creation is expected and monitored
 *
 *  Step A2: send a SetConfiguration message to make server inactive; and then expect a StateChangedEvent message
 *      - send a SetConfiguration message
 *        within sequence diagram "Unitialized to Inactive" this implements steps 2 and 3
 *      - expect a StateChangedEvent message
 *        within sequence diagram "Unitialized to Inactive" this implements step 7
 *
 *  Step A3: send a SetStateRequest message to make server active; and then expect StateChangedEvent message
 *      - send a SetStateRequest message
 *        within sequence diagram "Inactive to Active" this implements steps 2 and 3
 *      - expect StateChangedEvent message
 *        within sequence diagram "Inactive to Active" this implements step 7
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  All API calls are handled by the server.

 * Code:
