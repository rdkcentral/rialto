/*
 * Component Test: Set Configuration with Socket fd
 * Test Objective:
 *  Establish Rialto Server <-> Rialto client connection using file description
 *  provided by Rialto Server Manager stub.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Application+Session+Management
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: Control
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Initialize Rialto Server service
 *  Create named socket with file descriptor
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Register Rialto Client Stub in RUNNING state
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Send SetConfiguration message with socket file descriptor
 *   ServerManager stub requests the server to configure.
 *   Expect that server is configured correctly
 *
 *  Step 2: Connect Rialto Client stub
 *   Rialto Client tries to connect to socket provided by Rialto Server
 *   Expect that rialto client can be connected successfully
 *
 *  Step 3: Register Rialto Client Stub in RUNNING state
 *   Rialto Client sends a request to register to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that rialto client can be registered successfully
 *
 *  Step 4: Perform healthcheck procedure to test if connection is stable
 *   ServerManager stub requests the server to check state of all its components
 *   Expect that all server services are not deadlocked.
 *   Expect that PingEvent is received by connected Rialto Client stub.
 *   Rialto Client stub sends Ack message to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that Rialto Server sends Ack to Server Manager Stub
 *
 *  Step 5: Simulate server crash and recovery
 *   Close server service without cleanup
 *   Reset all connections
 *   Restart service
 *
 *  Step 6: Configure recovered server with the same configuration data
 *   ServerManager stub requests the server to configure.
 *   Expect that server is configured correctly
 *
 *  Step 7: Connect Rialto Client stub
 *   Rialto Client tries to connect to socket provided by Rialto Server
 *   Expect that rialto client can be connected successfully
 *
 *  Step 8: Register Rialto Client Stub in RUNNING state
 *   Rialto Client sends a request to register to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that rialto client can be registered successfully
 *
 *  Step 9: Perform healthcheck procedure to test if connection is stable
 *   ServerManager stub requests the server to check state of all its components
 *   Expect that all server services are not deadlocked.
 *   Expect that PingEvent is received by connected Rialto Client stub.
 *   Rialto Client stub sends Ack message to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that Rialto Server sends Ack to Server Manager Stub
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Rialto Server <-> Rialto Client connection should be established successfully
 *  using socket file descriptor provided by server manager stub
 *
 * Code:
