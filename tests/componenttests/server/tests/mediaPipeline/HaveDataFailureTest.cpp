/*
 * Component Test: Have Data Failure Test
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test the behaviour of Rialto Server, when it receives HaveData with Error status. Rialto Server should
 *  send next NeedMediaData to rialto server and be ready to continue playback.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Start/Resume Playback, Pause Playback, Stop, End of stream
 *   - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach all sources
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 5: Audio HaveData Failure
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that it needs audio data
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *   Client Stub will send HaveData with Error status
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *
 *  Step 6: Video HaveData Failure
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that it needs video data
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of video data.
 *   Client Stub will send HaveData with Error status
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of video data.
 *
 *  Step 14: Remove sources
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *   Remove the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 15: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 16: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is unmapped.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  All API calls are handled by the server.
 *  Rialto Server sends new NeedMediaDataEvent after receiving Error HaveData.
 *
 * Code:
