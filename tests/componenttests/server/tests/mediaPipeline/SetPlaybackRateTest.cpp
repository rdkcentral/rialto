 * Component Test: Set Playback Rate
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that set playback rate can be handled successfully.

 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Set Playback Rate - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach all sources
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is in playing state
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *
 *  Step 5: SetPlaybackRate
 *   Send SetPlaybackRateRequest
 *   Expect that gstreamer is requested to change playback rate
 *   Expect that successful SetPlaybackRateResp is received
 *
 *  Step 6: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 7: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is unmapped.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Set playback rate succeeds in the playing state.
 *  Success response is returned to client.
