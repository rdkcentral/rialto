/*
 * Component Test: Audio only Playback Sequence
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test the playback of single audio MSE content. The test transitions through the playback states
 *  buffering 1 frame of audio content before preroll and 1 frame of audio
 *  content after preroll. The session is then terminated. All the metadata and media data written to the
 *  shared buffer is checked for accuracy.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Create, Destroy - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=226375556
 *  Start/Resume Playback, Pause Playback, Stop, End of stream
 *   - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Playback+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach audio source
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 5: Write 1 audio frame
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that it needs audio data
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *   Write 1 frame of audio data to the shared buffer.
 *   Send HaveData message
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *
 *  Step 6: Notify buffered
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *
 *  Step 7: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is in playing state
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to PLAYING.
 *
 *  Step 8: Write 1 audio frame
 *   Write 1 frame of audio data to the shared buffer.
 *   Send HaveData
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 24 frames of audio data.
 *
 *  Step 9: End of audio stream
 *   Send audio haveData with one frame and EOS status
 *   Expect that Gstreamer is notified about end of stream
 *
 *  Step 10: Notify end of stream
 *   Simulate, that gst_message_eos is received by Rialto Server
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to END_OF_STREAM.
 *
 *  Step 11: Remove source
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 12: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 13: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is unmapped.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  All API calls are handled by the server.
 *  The state of the Gstreamer Pipeline is successfully negotiationed in the normal playback scenario.
 *  Data is successfully read from the shared memory and pushed to gstreamer pipeline for both audio and video.
 *
 * Code:
