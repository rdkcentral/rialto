/*
 * Component Test: Playback content when audio source has been removed and reattached.
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that video only playback can continue if the audio source is removed, and that audio can be restarted
 *  when it is reattached.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Rialto Dynamic Audio Stream Switching
 *   - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ASP&title=Rialto+Dynamic+Audio+Stream+Switching
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach all sources
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *
 *  Step 5: Write video and audio frames
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Write audio frames.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 6: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is playing.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PLAYING.
 *
 *  Step 7: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 8: Remove Audio Source
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 9: Write video frames
 *   Write video frames.
 *
 *  Step 10: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is playing.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PLAYING.
 *
 *  Step 11: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 12: Reattach audio source
 *   Attach the audio source again.
 *   Expect that reattach procedure is triggered.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *
 *  Step 13: Write video and audio frames
 *   Write video frames.
 *   Write audio frames.
 *
 *  Step 14: Play
 *   Play the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is playing.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PLAYING.
 *
 *  Step 15: Remove sources
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *   Remove the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 16: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 17: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is unmapped.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Video playback is unaffected when audio source is removed mid playback.
 *  Audio can be reattached and playback of both video and audio resumes.
 *
 * Code:
