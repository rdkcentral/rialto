 * Component Test: Set Source Position success
 * Test Objective:
 *  Test that Set Source Position is successfully handled.
 *
 * Sequence Diagrams:
 *  Set Source Position - https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/ASP/Rialto+Flush+and+Seek+Design
 *
 * Test Setup:
 *  Language: C++
 *  Testing Framework: Google Test
 *  Components: MediaPipeline
 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.
 *
 *  Step 3: Attach all sources
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *
 *  Step 5: Write 1 audio frame
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that it needs audio data
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *   Write 1 frame of audio data to the shared buffer.
 *   Send HaveData message
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of audio data.
 *
 *  Step 6: Write 1 video frame
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that it needs video data
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of video data.
 *   Write 1 frame of video data to the shared buffer.
 *   Send HaveData message
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that it needs 3 frames of video data.
 *
 *  Step 7: Notify buffered and Paused
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to BUFFERED.
 *   Gstreamer Stub notifies, that pipeline state is in PAUSED state
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 8: Set Audio Source Position
 *   Trigger set source position procedure for audio source
 *   Expect that SetSourcePositionResponse has success status
 *   Expect that after HaveData, new audio sample is pushed
 *
 *  Step 9: Set Video Source Position
 *   Trigger set source position procedure for video source
 *   Expect that SetSourcePositionResponse has success status
 *   Expect that after HaveData, new video sample is pushed
 *
 *  Step 10: End of audio stream
 *   Send audio haveData with one frame and EOS status
 *   Expect that Gstreamer is notified about end of stream
 *
 *  Step 11: End of video stream
 *   Send video haveData with one frame and EOS status
 *   Expect that Gstreamer is notified about end of stream
 *
 *  Step 12: Notify end of stream
 *   Simulate, that gst_message_eos is received by Rialto Server
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to END_OF_STREAM.
 *
 *  Step 13: Remove sources
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *   Remove the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 14: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 15: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
 *
 * Test Teardown:
 *  Memory region created for the shared buffer is unmapped.
 *  Server is terminated.
 *
 * Expected Results:
 *  Set Source Position is handled and forwarded to the gstreamer.
 *
 * Code:
