 * Test Setup:

 *
 * Test Initialize:
 *  Set Rialto Server to Active
 *  Connect Rialto Client Stub
 *  Map Shared Memory
 *
 * Test Steps:
 *  Step 1: Create a new media session
 *   Send CreateSessionRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful CreateSessionResponse is received
 *   Save returned session id
 *
 *  Step 2: Load content
 *   Send LoadRequest to Rialto Server
 *   Expect that successful LoadResponse is received
 *   Expect that GstPlayer instance is created.
 *   Expect that client is notified that the NetworkState has changed to BUFFERING.

 *  Step 3: Attach all sources
 *   Attach the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is attached.
 *   Attach the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is attached.
 *   Expect that rialto source is setup
 *   Expect that all sources are attached.
 *   Expect that the Playback state has changed to IDLE.
 *
 *  Step 4: Pause
 *   Pause the content.
 *   Expect that gstreamer pipeline is paused.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Network state has changed to PAUSED.
 *
 *  Step 5: Render Frame
 *   Send RenderFrameReq and expect successful response
 *
 *  Step 6: Remove sources
 *   Remove the audio source.
 *   Expect that audio source is removed.
 *   Remove the video source.
 *   Expect that video source is removed.
 *
 *  Step 7: Stop
 *   Stop the playback.
 *   Expect that stop propagated to the gstreamer pipeline.
 *   Expect that server notifies the client that the Playback state has changed to STOPPED.
 *
 *  Step 8: Destroy media session
 *   Send DestroySessionRequest.
 *   Expect that the session is destroyed on the server.
